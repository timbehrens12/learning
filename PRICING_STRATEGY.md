## 🧠 **Psychology Analysis**

### **Why Credits Work Better for Students:**

1. **Variable Demand**: Students don't need help every day
   - Midterms = high usage
   - Regular weeks = low usage
   - Monthly subscription = waste during low-usage periods

2. **Lower Commitment Friction**:
   - $9.99 one-time feels less risky than $9.99/month recurring
   - No "subscription guilt" when not using it
   - Easier to justify to parents

3. **Scarcity Psychology**:
   - Running low on credits creates urgency
   - "Only 3 credits left!" triggers impulse purchases
   - Monthly = no urgency, can always use it "later"

4. **Perceived Value**:
   - Credits feel like "I'm paying for what I use"
   - Monthly feels like "I'm paying even when I don't use it"

### **Why Monthly Still Matters:**

1. **Power Users**: Some students use it daily (10% of users, 40% of revenue)
2. **Predictable Revenue**: Better for business forecasting
3. **Higher Lifetime Value**: $9.99/month × 12 = $119.88/year vs $9.99 one-time

## 🎯 **Why This Pricing Works**

### **1. Price Anchoring**

- Monthly = "I'm paying even when I don't need it"
- Students prefer credits for flexibility

### **4. Competitive Positioning**
- Chegg: $19.95/month (too expensive)
- Course Hero: $9.95/month (cheap but limited)
- **You**: $14.99/month OR flexible credits (best of both)
